test project exploring js sound api's and midi control


This project is being developed as a node / react application to be run in the AWS system.

Dev tools in use (an ongoing list)
1. yarn (for 'flatter' npm management)
2. eslint / airbnb standards (for obnoxiously strict code standards)
3. webpack (for bundling distribution)
4. babel (ecma6 / 2015 compatibility)
5. node / react (server and server side rendering)

Forthcoming
1. sass (for pretty css stuffs)
2. docker (for AWS deployment)

To begin
- simply run 'yarn install in your project folder in the terminal client'
- execute the build process with 'npm run build'
- 'npm run start' should initiate your local host server for testing
